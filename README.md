# Saliou Diop . Jarvis Consulting

My name is Saliou Diop and I graduated in February 2022 with a B.S. in Applied Computer Science Co-op from Université de Moncton. During my school, I did three coop internships where I learned to collaborate with other team members in creating secure and reliable software solutions. In high school, I had an opportunity to interact with computers. They have been my passion, especially in writing code. The feeling that I can create anything from several lines of code and it could be useful to other people encouraged me to pursue a career as a software developer

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SaliouDiop](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SaliouDiop)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SaliouDiop/tree/master/linux_sql)]: The purpose of this project is to design and implement a cluster that will help the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration team to manage multiple Linux clusters running on CENTOS 7. This project is going to allow the LCA to keep track of each node hardware characteristics and monitor resource utilization in real time saved in a relational database management system. This project is built using Linux command lines, Bash scripts, PostgreSQL, Docker and Git.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SaliouDiop/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Developed a Java application (Command Line Interface) that can create, read and delete tweets from the CLI using Twitter REST API. The Java app builds the URI required and sends HTTP requests to the API using Apache HTTP components and Signpost 0auth library. The response is return in JSON format. This app is designed following the MVC design pattern consisting of a Model layer, Service layer and a DAO layer. The project is built using Java 11, Maven, JUnit 5 & Mockito, Docker, Twitter REST API
  - JDBC App: Developed a JDBC apps to perform queries on a PostgresSQL database. The database stores information about customers, products, orders , and salesperson. The CRUD operations are implemented using the Data Access Objects (DAO) and Data Transfer Objects (DTO) pattern.The project is built using Java, Maven, PostgresSQL (running on a docker container), and the JDBC API.
  - Grep App: Implemented a program to mimic Linux grep commands. The program will read all the files in the current directory and every directory below the current one looking in each file for a given regular expression. The output is written to an output file in the root directory.This project is written in Java (using Streams, Lambda, and RegEx pattern matching), Maven for packaging, and Docker for easy deployment.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SaliouDiop/tree/master/springboot)]: Not Started


## Highlighted Projects
**Netflix REST API** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Saliou1920/netflix-api)]: Build a Netflix clone REST API that allows you to add movies, series and authenticate a user using Express JS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Json Web Token, Helmet.

**Jobs API** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Saliou1920/jobs-api)]: This API is built to manage careers. It helps people organize their job applications. Once you apply for a job, you can organize and track progress in a central portal. You need to register or log in to use this API.

**Images Gallery** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Saliou1920/Images-Gallery)]: A web app that uses the Unsplash API to display beautiful images. The user can search for images by keyword, and can also save the images to their collection. The user can also view their saved images. This project is built using React, React-Router, Unplash API, Firebase authentification.

**BLOG** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Saliou1920/Blog)]: A blog website that uses MYSQL to store and retrieve data. The admin can create a new post, edit an existing post, and delete a post. He can also create a new user, edit an existing user, and delete a user. This project is built using PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MYSQL and CodeIgniter.

**Detection of Malware Applications in Android Smartphones** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Saliou1920/Blog)]: Developed a deep learning model that can detect malware on android smartphones. Achieved an accuracy of 97%.
