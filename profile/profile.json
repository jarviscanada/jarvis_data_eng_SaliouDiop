During my school, I did three coop internships where I learned to collaborate with other team members in creating secure and reliable software solutions. In high school, I had an opportunity to interact with computers. They have been my passion, especially in writing code. The feeling that I can create anything from several lines of code and it could be useful to other people encouraged me to pursue a career as a software developer"
