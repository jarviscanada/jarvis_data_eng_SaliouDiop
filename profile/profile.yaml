# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: My name is Saliou Diop and I graduated in February 2022 with a B.S. in Applied Computer Science Co-op from Université de Moncton. During my school, I did three coop internships where I learned to collaborate with other team members in creating secure and reliable software solutions. In high school, I had an opportunity to interact with computers. They have been my passion, especially in writing code. The feeling that I can create anything from several lines of code and it could be useful to other people encouraged me to pursue a career as a software developer
